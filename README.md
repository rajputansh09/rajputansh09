## 💼 About Me  

Hi, I’m Ansh Rajput — a passionate developer who thrives at the intersection of **engineering logic** and **creative design**. I specialize in building software solutions across the tech stack: from responsive full-stack web applications 🌐, to immersive game environments 🎮, and hardware-integrated embedded systems 🔌.

I’ve contributed as a:
- **Quality Management Intern** at *Indraprastha Systemcert Pvt. Ltd.*, where I led audits, streamlined technical documents, and ensured ISO compliance.
- **Marketing Research Intern** at *ICICI Lombard*, conducting stakeholder analysis and presenting actionable insights to senior leadership.

These experiences refined my ability to solve problems, optimize processes, and collaborate across disciplines — traits I now channel into building user-centric, performance-oriented software systems.
